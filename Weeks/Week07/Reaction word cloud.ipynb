    "words = \"Individual Assignment HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities Read chapter 'Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media' (pages 139-159) And one or all of the following: Iran (pages 134-139) Egypt (pages 159-171) Japan (pages 171-202) Write a one paragraph reaction to the book chapter and chosen section (Iran, Egypt, or Japan), and come up with one or two questions for the authors. Be prepared to talk about your reaction next week. Frida My reaction I felt surprised reading the text because I was not aware of the impact social media, specifically Twitter had on the Revolutions of Egypt even when the group of Twitter users might not have been ideally representative in terms of statistics. I think that as I learn more and more about various social media platforms and their effects on society, its importance for social justice and expression becomes larger and larger. I think the network graphs are really powerful in showing the relationship between the words and show their usage in full effect when discussing Egypt in a Global View. Overall, I think the different colors, words and connections really help emphasize the movement increasing its impact on people who see these images. Question In your perspective, what do you think the future of digital humanities is? What effects do you think the mapping of these historical events will have on the societies that are the points of focus? Stacy DH and Media Data I thought the idea that the digital humanities should be researched and implement methods that do not create boundaries of what is worthy of researching and what is not. Although the chapter starts on this rather inspirational note, one should not be under the impression that representation is upheld consistently in this field. The reading, however, does remind one of the powers of social media. Although one is quick to judge the negative of social media, there are so many possibilities with the information and data it has provided, not only to its users, but those who can further knowledge through it. In connection to my point earlier, I cannot help but discuss that there are many who take for granted the availability of social media, especially when we have the opportunity to strike a conversation and protest through it. Those protesting the election in Tehran were not to do what we in the states can because their media is controlled by the state, like in. This only brings to question how can digital humanities effectively promote inclusion in research that uses media data like that of Iran. Question: On the note of participation without condition, what are your thoughts on how this may relate to the availability of research? more specifically, the inabilty to access some resources because they are not a part of the free domain and have to purchase such information. Stephanie HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities Reflection After reading the chapter on Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media, I thought about how social media has changed the landscape. Because I'm someone who grew up with social media, I don't really think of the impact that it makes. Seeing how it can give voice to people who are silenced, reveal patterns in data, or see individual experiences, you can see how powerful it is. As I read about the protests in Egypt and how it gives a voice to the protestors, the idea of fake news on social media also came to my head Thus, I was glad when the chapter addressed how social media could be used for authoritarian means and be manipulated to amplify misinformation on a global scale. It was also so interesting to read about HyperCities Now and how they curate data in different ways in order to expand the concept of the public sphere and how knowledge is being democratized. Bringing what I read into what we're experiencing now with Covid-19, social media has definitely been a way for us to gain knowledge about the subject, from when it first originated to vaccines that are being produced. I remember that when Covid-19 first broke out and people were unsure about how serious the situation was, there were people from Wuhan documenting and posting online videos and articles of what they're experiencing. This helped spread in giving them a voice, even if the government did not want the news to spread. However, I also know that there has been an abundance of fake news, with some people I know believing that the vaccine is bad due to infographics and news they saw on social media. Reading about how Eskandar showed how protests are widespread and happening all over Iran, boosting morale, was heartwarming to me. I could see how powerful the project he worked on was, and how big of an impact it made. This also made me think of the black lives matter, as protests and petitions are able to happen due to how social media is able to spread the information and build morale. Question How do we better democraticize knowledge while still ensuring that the knowledge you are gaining is trustworthy? Paige What stood out to me most in this chapter of the book was a line on page 146: 'As such, the event is no longer the same event because it is constantly re-constituted by other events, representations, and disseminations that recursively coalesce'. This then leads to the public sphere being built by different individuals/communities in these feedback loops that ultimately have so many stories and places connected through the common space (i.e. social media). This thought has been one I have thought o fbefore when reflecting on the power of social media, however its application on a global scale is new to me. Further, it brings social media being seen as a simple post from an old friend and moves into the power it holds for the public domain as a whole. This is a good and bad thing, as described as such in the chapter, and there are so many more complexities than I have initially thought of. The bad coming from things like misinformation, which I argue are insanely detrimental to societies and the world as a whole for spreading information, as repittion of falsehoods are often taken as true which in turn completely alters how societies may view or think they know another culture. The negatives aside, however, learning of HyperCities Now for the events in Egypt and seeing how useful it was as a source for individuals to be more vulnerable with their experiences was so meaningful to read about. The details of the behind the scenes is equally as important: making parameters for distance in Egypt and specific hashatags used when publid data was so limited in the nation without internet. It is how social media should be used: to help others and created by other humans who make cognitive decisions off how/what will be shared. I further chose to read about Japan and the real-time disaster relief from 5,000+ miles away with GIS CrisisCommons. It blew my mind to see how many reports of incidents were reported via Twitter, 700 million tweers collected is insane. The sentiment analysis on said tweets around the time of Japan's crises were equally as enlightening, solidifying and bringing to light that there are real emotions behind the words printed on someone's Twitter feed, even if many people may feel like a tweet or RT is just that, rather than the distant person on the other end. By the time stamps and locations of tweets, and the content in which they held, it is moving to see how Twitter data can be used in such a way that explains a story, that relays events moment by moment with emption attached. It gives a global news story a heartbeat, and that is so important for people to realize in the public sphere. Data analysis, and all its components, make that possible. Emily HyperCities shows the extent that digital humanities can have in the world, real time. I am so impressed with how fast the collection of Tweets in the Egypt incident happened. Learning about examples of digital humanities in the wild makes the subject seem more applicable and worthwhile topic in the real world—its not just theoretical or only classroom based. In the Egypt section, it was interesting how the event was categorized and understood as a network in order to understand it and visualize it. I think it is important when working with data such as this to reimagine it in a way that makes it easier to analyze and extrapolate information from it. How were the hashtags used determined? Ainsleigh After reading through the assigned pages and the section on Iran I had a realization of social responsibility on social media. For the most part in the United States, it's shocking if the information on social media is blocked or deleted but there are obviously cases where it's understood that the post will be taken down. I thought deeply into the concept written in this book about “participation without condition” and how everyone should be able to tell his or her story to contribute to the collective record. This has obviously changed over time from word of mouth to permanence on the internet, as well as unstoppable spread. I think it’s understood that everyone thinks differently and has different motivations but it’s easy for echo chambers reinforced by social media to give people a false sense of popular opinion. In the case of Iran, it wasn't the abundance of information, it was the lack thereof that created the echo chamber. In times it may seem critical to silence a voice to help many but thoughts, by relation tweets, are unpredictable at their essence. One voice may be silenced but another will take its place. The only way to approach this is to filter and organize what’s important to you on your own individual basis. Tiffany This week, I had the opportunity to read part of the book, 'HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities.' In the chapter 'Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media' (pages 139-159), I learned about how in Digital Humanities, something that digital humanists often try to aim for is the concept of 'participation without condition'. Through this idea, digital humanities allows for accessibility to all to tell their story and to contribute to the overall narrative. From the concept, digital humanists have developed the idea of HyperCities, which enables geographic data to be combined with social media posts, which can be contributed by all. What I enjoyed about this chapter is how it not only explored the many amazing possibilities of technology like this, but also the complications that can arise. With social media being so accessible, it not only allows for anyone to contribute their perspective to an event, but it also leads to misinformation being easily amplified and spread globally. In the section on Iran and the use of HyperCities to document the 2009 Election Protests in Tehran, I was able to get a glimpse into an early use of this technology. HyperCities and social media was used to document and spread word about the people's stance at a time when the government was claiming something contradictory. It was very interesting to see how HyperCities were adapted in a early setting during the first 'Twitter Revolution'. Questions for the authors: How have HyperCities been used after the events have supposedly 'ended'? Do tweets and social media posts continue to be collected? Richard Humanists have found ways to broadcast the voices of the people, whether through twitter or other hosting websites. People are supporting others who are having their freedoms at risk. Misinformation is an issue faced by all sides in social media, being able to decipher what is true is important for movements to be effective. An issue teams, like Hypercities, face is the number of people reporting. For example, only 5% of people in Egypt used social media during the revolution. Growing the network of people on social media would give others more information and more stories. They have many context to data issues, like defining when events “end”. Tricky problems like this mean exhaustive definitions to make sure the information relayed is correct and interpreted as intended. I sometimes neglect to think about how protestors must evade authority seeing their social media posts. If a government lacked democracy, posts could lead authorities to track and reprimand protestors. This is an example of the people wanting their voice be heard and the oppressor trying to silence them. In Iran, westerners tried aiding the distribution of information during protests. They tried to give time sensitive information for the movements to have some amount of coordination. In America, movements are able to organize and spread their message a lot easier, this isn’t the case in other countries. I realized that even things like slogans were unifying for the protestors. There is importance in creating and mapping the timeline of events for the movement in Iran, it enables a history and story to tell. Question 1: How are they able to make sure their contacts in the countries they are trying to assist are credible? Question 2: How are the sources confident/how do we make them more confident in willing to leak the information they aim to broadcast. Claire In the chapter, 'Mapping events/Mapping Social Media,' I thought it was amazing how social media data could be used to analyze revolutions and other historical events. In the chapter, the athor writes that, 'it seems incontestable that the 'public images' produced by broadcast media are being supplanted by decentralized, multi- directional 'public utterances' that are changing the way in which events unfold, become represented, and are diseeminated.' This quote particularly stood out to me because it shows the power of social media in this current age and how participants experiencing events first-hand have a voice, not only in how events are seen and portrayed in history, but also in how they unfold in the present. For instance, during the Egyptian revolution, a surge of twitter data on February 10th and 11th about shifts in power could have been a sign that the revolution was reaching an inflection point. Each of the individual tweets and stories from people experiencing the event served as simple acts that built a community and a large, complex network that defined the evnt in history. However, while social media allows for individual voices to be heard, the authors of the chapter also acknowledge how unreliable social media data can be and how it can amplify misinformation on a global scale. Many different contradictory perspectives can being expressed through traditional and social media which could potentially cause these events to fall victim to information overload. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of an overwhelming amount of contradictory infromation and misinformation caused many people to ignore proper COVID-19 safety and health protocols. On this note, I would ask the authors of the book how they would analyze social media data about COVID-19 and if any current data trends show turning points during the pandemic. Alessandro I chose to delve deeper in “the mapping of the 2009 election in Tehran.” Due to the reelection of Mohamed Ahmadinejad the citizens of Iran were angered because of his supposed “coup government”. In Iran there was a limited amount of news coverage available since Tehran is state-run, it was noted that the mapping project had to be conducted. The authors have the intentions of disproving anarchy and bureaucracy of the Iranian government and showing that the protests were in fact widespread spanning many regions of Iran. Acclaimed the “Twitter Protest”, the Iranian government refused to cover the events. Twitter user were able to see the intensity of the protest broadcasted by Iranian twitter users under the “#Iran Election” title. With the help of an IT programmer from San Francisco named Austin Heap, the authors tracked the uploads from the Iranian twitter users. Furthermore, the authors used google maps to extrapolate communities and find protest leaders around Iran. The goal of this was to bolster the “honest news” coming out of Iran and investigate the validity. Lastly, the authors put the information in chronological order to timestamp the events leading up to the protest. The outcome of the coverage was to withdraw the solidarity associated with the movement, thereby limiting the effect and trauma for people suffering the reign of Mohamed Ahmadinejad. Now I transition into “Mapping Events and Mapping Social Media”. It begins with citing participation as the root of cultural humanity and how that is interwoven into aspects like race and culture. Even more, participation plays a central role in community engagement and digital humanities. The authors mention the ideas of Michel Foucault claims that participation is “open-minded” and is a condition which is constructed in our imagination. Lastly, the author mentions the importance of social media to dissect the issues and we can see how important Twitter was in coverage and validity of the aforementioned events of “the reelection of 2009 in Tehran”.[1] Ariel It was a great point to make that when mass tweets are read together they are given equal weight when in fact they probably shouldn't be. I was not at all aware of the efforts done against government-controlled media. Especially when it comes to Iran, where my parents are from. I in general have a negative outlook towards social media but seeing that there are still a few that use it for good gives me hope that social media still has a place in the world. My questions for the author are how did you identify misinformation? How did you handle the misinformation? And all the while, how did you remove your own bias? Adam Reading the assigned chapters from the book, I was kind of surprised. I think the idea of HyperCities is super cool, the idea isn't super complicated on paper. But it's something that I'm surprised I hadn't seen before. I really liked the three kinds of temporality described, as it uses concepts I know inherently but haven't thought of explicitly. Concerning mapping protests, I think there's something special there to be spoken for. It helps to bring the people together and add cohesiveness to the cause, again why I'm surprised I havent seen something like this before. A question I have for the authors is, 'How would you change aspects of the project to account for the ambiguity/ uncertainty or bias in working with social media data. Haley From the section, “Mapping the 2009 Election Protests in Tehran,” I found it extremely interesting how the government controls the media and portrayed that only the wealthy people in the north were protesting, but the researcher was able to use social media to reveal that the discontent was much more widespread. By analyzing a hashtag to follow the event and the sentiments of the people, he was able to send maps to protest leaders to help them see that there were others who shared their discontent, thus helping fuel their motivation to continue the fight. I find this participation, this collaboration very inspiring. It was brilliant how he used timelines and visualizations to extract poetry of the people in Tehran and share their true sentiments with the West. Otherwise, we would have been more likely to believe the censored, inaccurate story that was being told by the government, and thus would not have known the real experiences of the protestors themselves. This shows how truly delicate history is, and the responsibility we have to check the perspective it is told from and to help ensure the voices of those experiencing these events remain at the center of this storytelling. I enjoyed the chapter that we read because it articulately explained what participatory culture and digital humanities are and how social media analysis provides ”... both a retrospective and prospective record, historical and future-oriented at the same time, as the archive is not simply a question of what is past but, perhaps more urgently, a question of what is to come, a responsibility to a future that embraces, knows, and is informed by its many pasts.” This is powerful stuff. I appreciated the authors’ discussion of time as a ‘flash’, a ‘network’ and ‘chronos,’ as well as the ethical position of spectators of these events. I also appreciate how the authors discussed the limitations and vulnerabilities of utilizing social media to chronicle historical events, as these are important to keep in mind when analyzing social media data. Questions: Is this participatory, real-time nature of digital humanities going to ultimately replace how historical knowledge is created and conveyed in the future? Or do you think the traditional approach to history will remain dominant, and the digital humanities will only serve as a branch? Digital Humanities is still a relatively new field: How do you envision the field evolving in the future? This method of data compilation and storytelling certainly has many positive attributes; but as mentioned in the paper, the participatory nature can contribute to an echo chamber of false information being accepted as fact. As we participate in this approach, what methods can we use to either filter this information or ensure that we garner the most accurate, inclusive and well-intentioned data to represent events like the ones mentioned in the text? Henry This week's reading goes over the idea of 'participation without condition' in which people can bear witness to events and engage in discourse without any barriers of access, specifically from higher institutions of powers. Especially in the face of digital humanities, there have been great pushes to create space (primarily online) in which participants can engage with 'broader publics in the design, creation, and dissemination of knowledge.' Social technologies like Twitter and Youtube have been used by people to showcase narratives that have been silenced by the government. For example, the Iran chapter discusses how protestors used Twitter and YouTube to archive election protests in Tehran, as most footage of protests were censored by the government and deemed 'anti-government' in the mainstream media. These platforms allowed protestors to give truth to their side of the story and raise attention to the unrest occurring in Iran on a global scale. And while much good can come out of social media, we must always view and consume media critically and cautiously. This is because anyone, such as political leaders, can access these platforms and use them for their own ends--whether that be democratic or authoritarian. A clear example of this is former President Trump egging his followers via Tweeter to commit insurrection and storm the Capitol. As a result, my question is 'While 'participation without condition' is a huge tenant of digital humanities, is it acceptable to set certain 'guidelines' and restrict individuals from engaging in discourse if it means preventing hateful and dangerous rhetoric?' Keven On Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media What caught my attention in this chapter was the participation from the individuals to develop an idea to get the voices that have been silenced back online. Reading this chapter I found it very surprising the power of digital humanities and the far reaching influence it can have on the world. The idea to map location based information and tweets to allow the public have an eye on what was going on in Egypt was a very cool and important to concept for the world to see. However, the access to this technology and the ability that only a very few, as mentioned, wealthy educated individuals have to promote this idea is very limited. But the concepts of bringing in many individuals to participate, involve themselves in the democratic process and help others seek the freedoms they are searching for, is beneficiary for everyone. Mapping the 2009 Election Protests in Tehran This project helped make it more technical and clear for me on how this individual developed the HyperCities platform. I was surprised on the amount of public and voluntary data they were able to recieve to make this work. Also having to swtich to proxy servers to avoid government intervention was also very notable to do. The participation that is mentioned at the begining of the next chapter is very aparent here, where the individual took that action to help out a community that was being silenced. I found this project super interesting and very inspirational. Questions What can go wrong with releasing information that was at first silenced by the government? Are there companies/ individuals profiting of ideas like this? Juliette After reading about the uprising against the fraudulent elections in Iran and Hypercities, I can say that I am both impressed and nervous about the future of Digital Humanities. To address my first feeling, I am extremely impressed by the ways in which people have used social media to overcome censorship and disaster. It is extraordinary that citizens of Iran were able to turn the tides against the authoritarian government in order to spread the word of their injustices to the world. It really goes to show the ability for social media to give a voice to those whom the powerful once deemed silent. On the other hand, what I think is also disturbing is the fact that the Government recognizes the true power behind these voices and is not afraid to start targeting them one by one until the cry for justice quiets down to that of whisper. What I also think is concerning is the idea mentioned in the reading of an ”echo chamber” of misinformation. While social media gives us an opportunity to join with and strengthen the collective voices for noble causes, with misinformation, this powerful entity then has the ability to spread and echo harmful information that is believed by others only due to the sheer volume of people believing in it (which I think was perfectly said in the article). Ultimately this reading really exemplifies the power that Social Media and Digital Humanities has for better and for worse, and we can only hope that going into the future that these instruments for connection and gathering are used for the right reasons and with good intent. Personally, as more and more events such as the Twitter revolution in Iran happen, I get more nervous that if not already, that the government will gain superior techniques and technological devices to silence protesters. They definitely have more money, more time, and more manpower to keep up in the ever changing technology sphere, and they will continue to develop this technology in order to silence others who disagree with their position. In addition, it is already difficult to pass laws protecting the privacy of online users, and I know these loose restrictions will be used against those who are unaware of the threat of censorship or jailing. Take for example the BLM protests. The FBI and police targeted Black activists and sent police to their front doors in acts of intimidation all because they were able to find their information from metadata online. To me, these sorts of threatening acts are grave violations of user privacy, since there was no imminent threat or reason to target these individuals and take their metadata except for the fact that they were protesting against the corrupt police force. This intimidation did nothing but show citizens “we are watching, and we are not afraid to take action'. Ultimately, as technology advances, I am hopeful about society's ability to connect for social good, but I worry that as long as the government has the upperhand in the technological censorship game, that we still will play by their rules, that as we can see in Iran, can be rigged. My questions to the author after reading this article would be “In what ways do you feel that social media platforms have a responsibility to the public to provide open and unbiased spaces for dialogue? Do private companies have any sort of ethical duty to step in and censor what they deem harmful to society? What laws and protections should governments create in order to preserve user privacy of their citizens? Hozumi I really enjoyed reading this article. These days, I see a lot of news and documentaries talking about how social media companies misuse user information and data and tend to have a negative impression towards social media. However, this article reminds me how social media can bring a positive impact on society. As the author mentioned, social technologies can be a tool to give voice to people, like the example of the 2011 revolution in Egypt. In addition, the example of sentiment analysis for the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake was very interesting to me. Disasters can bring a very negative impact on the mental health condition of many people. Unstable or unhealthy mental health conditions can also influence people's life and career. For example, I read the article about an old teen boy who lost his mother to the tsunami in 2011 when he was in the sixth grade of elementary school. His trauma of the earthquake and tsunami and the loss of a loved one affected his mental health. However, due to insufficient professional mental health support, he had struggled with depression for a long time and dropped out of high school. Therefore, I think the sentiment analysis of Twitter after a disaster would be helpful for creating a post-disaster mental health support program and preventing people from prolonged mental health issues as the old teenage boy experienced. In terms of questions, there are two questions I would like to ask to researchers. The first one is why did the researchers choose Twitter for social media analysis? The second one is since Facebook is the most popular social media today(Statista), would the researcher use facebook for analysis for social media analysis? Sine Reflection After reading the chapter, I found the conversations around the interconnectedness of events and the ethical implications of social media and data very interesting. It was very exciting to see how a tweet, a moment in time, can build and become such a huge project such as HyperCities. The network graphs in the Egypt section are a great demonstration of how events can be linked. Seeing the lines connecting between the various hashtags and then, between the Libya and Egypt events, was fascinating. Although each individual events and communities become difficult to see in the large graphs, knowing that they are an integral part of the whole is a broad view that I had never seen accurately visualized before. Furthermore, with the vast dispensary of data online and on social media, it is interesting to think about how what I do online is being analyzed and connected to various events. This is where the topic of ethics and bias comes in. Before it was mentioned in the chapter, I had not really thought about the ethical implications of studying events that don't necessarily affect me. At what point does looking and analyzing this data become exploitive rather than helpful? With data so out in the open, all it takes is one person with bad intentions to manipulate others. I think this is a conversation that should be more widely discussed in the future, especially since social media and digital media is becoming so integral to all our lives. Questions for the Authors How do you navitage the ethics of spatial and disaster data analysis? How can Twitter and/or other social media sites in the future make analysis easier and catered towards data scientists? Ethan A quote that stood out to me while reading this text was 'digital humanities expands both the notion of scholarship and the public sphere in order to create new sites and notes of engagement, documentation, and collaboration.' I believe that this truly encapsulates how widespread digital humanities can reach and grow as anacademic discipline and field. It is not just something that exists in the academic world but also studies and implements daily functions for the general public. Therefore, everyone is constantly contributing the development of digital humanities just as everyone is comtibuting to history in one way or another. Through psoing questions and challenging existing forms of thought, people continue to expand on and spread new knowledge to all corners of the earth. For example, with technology and things like social media, we are able to communicate with people from various locations and countires. This gives everyone the opportunity to share their stories and uplift their voices that may have been silenced by years of disconnect from the modern world and tragic power imbalances in governments. This is exemplified with the HyperCities where people created a mashup for live streaming and archiving Tweitter feeds from Egypt and visualizing them on a Google Map. Through technology like twitter, even protests in Iran were introduced and publicized to the media. Tools like the #iranelection help to quickly disseminate information all over the world. This demonstrates the power of digital humanities and its effect on the world. Questions How would one best minimize/mitigate the damaging effects of participation? It prevents there being restrictions by race, gender, classm, etc, but those in power may have more means to participate. Derek I really like the concept of participatory culture in that it involves scholarly collaboration and advocacy for erased communities with the purpose of documenting and disseminating information for humankind. I related to the point concerning the amplification of misinformation via social media because I see very questionable tweets and infographics around Twitter that spread like wildfire, with the most recent case being the #helpsai tweets that blew up last week where a girl posted an SOS call to the internet which later was found to be fake. The exposure allowed her to gain a large sum of money via GoFund Me. As for the crisis in Egypt, I thought it was especially interesting that although Twitter users were publicized as instigating the revolution, it is actually the influence of the working class that made up the majority of the resistance. As for the second part of the readings, I found it really cool to see how sentiments could be visualized/mapped in a temporal sense! Especially so when the sentiments ebb and flow with the events that continued to unfold in the aftermath of the incident. Lastly, I appreciate the normalization and scaling of the data so that “fear” and “weariness” were the predominant sentiments because the previous graphic could have been misleading. Jack As a math student interested in human activities and interactions on social media, this reading taught me a lot. I agree that participation without condition is the rooted value of digital humanity where the technologies are not. The citizen-scholars raise new questions or design new possibilities, and the newer technologies only bring new tools for analysis. The reading also reminds me of the position of social media. They could be powerful tools for amplifying people's voices globally, but the information generated can be easily manipulated and hard to verify. We need to be extra cautious when performing analysis. The discussion of a person's position in the event ('inside' vs. 'outside') was inspiring. I never thought of my position as an analyst outside places me in a questionable ethical position of a privileged observer of events that I took no part in. Data science without ethical considerations is dangerous, whether it be protecting personally identifiable data, implicit bias in automated decision-making, the social impacts of digital humanity studies, or the apparent divorce of truth and trust in virtual communication on social networks. Question: On page 178, the author mentioned that 'Communities are created by clusters of words, which are mentioned in proximity to each other.' Can you elaborate the idea/theory behind this statement? Haiqi Reading 'Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media' was a unique experience for me. While I have heard about the HyperCities Now project, I have never connected it to Digital Humaniites – to what we are learning now. I appreciate how the chapter mentions the ability of Digital Humanities to motivate social change. Accorrding to the authors, DH is expansive in many different contexts. For example, it breaks down the traditional boundaries surrounding and within different fields in academia; it does not just record the past but poses questions into the future. Reading the chapter about Tehran, I was impressed by how much thinking was put into the project. Mainly, it was crucial to create an integrated time-stamped map that shows all kinds of media people were posting. This is crucial because, while we can look at different mediums separately, putting them together and examining them can yield unexpected results and effects. This was enabled by HyperCities Now and the project successfully demonstrated a narrative different from the of the government. While reading this, I realized the importance to act quickly when problems arise – it would be better if we can predict some problems in the future and have existing structures in hand to respond quickly to events. \""
